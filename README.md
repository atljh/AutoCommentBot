Features

- **Automatic Commenting**: Monitors channels for new posts and adds comments based on pre-defined tones or prompts.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes multiple Telethon sessions to manage different accounts and proxies.
- **Comment Limiting and Sleep Mode**: Set limits on the number of comments per account and trigger a sleep period to avoid detection.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Logs all activities and gracefully handles errors like bans, mutes, and flood waits.
- **Proxy Support**: Configurable proxies for each account session.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Easily adjust the tone and style of comments using prompt-based instructions.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Telethon library
- OpenAI API key (for generating comments using GPT-based prompts)
- Telegram account(s) with active session files
- Proxy information for each account (optional)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-auto-comment-bot.git
   cd telegram-auto-comment-bot
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create the necessary files:
   - `config.txt`: For storing API keys and configuration settings.
   - `groups.txt`: List of channels to monitor.
   - `proxies.txt`: List of proxies (if needed).
   - Session files for each account should be placed in the `accounts/` folder.

5. Set up the `config.txt` file:
   ```txt
   api_id=<YOUR_API_ID>
   api_hash=<YOUR_API_HASH>
   openai_api_key=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
   ```

6. Prepare the `groups.txt` file: List the channels you want to monitor (without https://). Example:
   ```txt
   t.me/examplechannel1
   t.me/examplechannel2
   ```

7. Prepare the `proxies.txt` file (if using proxies):
   ```txt
   host:port:username:password
   ```

Usage

To run the bot, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

Bot Actions:
- Logs in using each account’s session file.
- Joins and monitors channels specified in `groups.txt`.
- Responds to new posts with contextually relevant comments using OpenAI-generated responses based on the provided prompt tone.

Configuration

### Setting Prompt Tone

The prompt for generating comments is defined within the script. You can customize it to change the tone and style of the comments. For example:
```txt
"Write a supportive and friendly comment that engages with the post. Express appreciation and interest, and ask a follow-up question to continue the conversation."
```

### Log Configuration

The bot logs all activities to `logs.log` and the console. You can configure the logging level and format in the script:
```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('logs.log', encoding='utf-8'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```
